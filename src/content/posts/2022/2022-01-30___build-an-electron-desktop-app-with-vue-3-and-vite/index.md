Recently, I wanted to rewrite my [Standup Picker](/standup-picker) in [Vue.js](https://v3.vuejs.org) that is currently implemented with Angular.

In this article, I will guide you through the process of setting up an [Electron](https://www.electronjs.org/) desktop app with Vue 3 and Vite.

## Setup Vite project

In this tutorial I will use [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) to setup a new Vue project:

> Vite is a build tool that aims to provide a faster and leaner development experience for modern web projects.

```
npm init @vitejs/app
cd [project-name]
npm install
```

## Add Electron

```
npm install --save-dev electron
```
