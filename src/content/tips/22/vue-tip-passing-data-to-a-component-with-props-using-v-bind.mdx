title: 'Vue Tip: Use v-bind to Pass Multiple Props to Components'

It's totally valid to bind multiple props to a Vue component:

```vue
<template>
  <Button
    :type="type"
    :color="color"
    :disabled="disabled"
    :test-id="testId"
    :icon="icon"
    @click="onClick"
    @custom="onCustom"
  >
    Login
  </Button>
</template>
```

For a cleaner template you can also `v-bind` to bind an object including all your property information to your component:

```vue
<template>
  <Button v-bind="button">Login</Button>
</template>

<script setup lang="ts">
const button = {
  type: 'submit',
  color: 'blue',
  disabled: false,
  testId: 'login-button',
  icon: 'arrow-right',
};
</script>
```

If you need to handle a lot of events you might want to group them using `v-on`:

```vue
<template>
  <Button v-on="buttonEventHandlers">Login</Button>
</template>

<script setup lang="ts">
const buttonEventHandlers = {
  onClick: () => console.log('Click'),
  onCustom: () => console.log('Custom Event'),
};
</script>
```

| `v-bind` and `v-on` works with Vue 2 and Vue 3.
