The [watch](https://vuejs.org/guide/essentials/watchers.html) option supports a dot-delimited path as key to watch nested values:

```vue
<script setup lang="ts">
import { watch } from 'vue';
import { useRoute } from 'vue-router';

const route = useRoute();

watch(
  () => route.query.id,
  queryId => {
    console.log('Route Query ID', queryId);
  }
);
</script>
```

The above example assumes that you are using the [Composition API](https://vuejs.org/guide/introduction.html#composition-api) with [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/).

If you are using [Options API](https://vuejs.org/guide/introduction.html#options-api) the code looks like this:

```vue
<script>
export default {
  watch: {
    // Note: only simple paths. Expressions are not supported.
    '$route.query.id'(queryId) {
      console.log('Route Query ID', queryId);
    },
  },
};
</script>
```
