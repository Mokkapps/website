The built-in [Vue 3 Teleport component](https://v3.vuejs.org/guide/teleport.html#teleport) allows us to render HTML outside
the Vue.js application. This can be useful to position modals, toast notifications, overlays, and more.

Sometimes, a component's template belongs logically to the component itself.
At the same time, from a technical point of view, it would be preferable to move this part of the template somewhere else in the DOM, outside of the Vue app.

A full-screen modal is a common scenario where you'd want to handle the modal's logic inside the component, but it should be positioned at a completely different place.

Teleport provides a clean way to allow us to control under which parent in the DOM we want a piece of HTML to be rendered,
without having to resort to global state or splitting this into two components:

```vue
<template>
  <teleport to="body">
    This will be appended to the body tag
  </teleport>
</template>
```

The `to` attribute should be a valid CSS selector outside the Vue application.
