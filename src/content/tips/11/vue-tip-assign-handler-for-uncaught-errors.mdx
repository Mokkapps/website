You should monitor your errors in production. Vue therefore provides the
[errorHandler](https://v3.vuejs.org/api/application-config.html#errorhandler) for uncaught errors during component render function and watchers.
The handler gets called with the error and the application instance.

```js
/**
* Handles Vue errors
* @param err - the error trace
* @param vm - VM component
* @param info - Vue-specific error info, e.g. which lifecycle hook the error was found in
*/
app.config.errorHandler = (err, vm, info) => {
  // handle error
}
```

Error tracking services [Sentry](https://sentry.io/for/vue/) and [Bugsnag](https://docs.bugsnag.com/platforms/browsers/vue/) provide official integrations for the `errorHandler`.

It's also possible to add the [errorCaptured](https://v3.vuejs.org/api/options-lifecycle-hooks.html#errorcaptured) lifecycle hook to your component.
It is called when an error from any descendent component is captured.
