What I love about [Vue](https://vuejs.org/) is that usually, it is performant without any manual optimization effort. Of course, there exist
unique scenarios where we need to optimize the performance, but therefore we first need to know how we can measure it.

Several great tools can help us to measure the performance. If you want to profile the load performance of your production deployment, you can use one of these tools:

* [PageSpeed Insights](https://pagespeed.web.dev/)
* [WebPageTest](https://www.webpagetest.org/)

If you want to profile the performance during local development, you can use one of these tools:

* [Chrome DevTools Performance Panel](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/evaluate-performance/)

[[info]]
| You can enable `app.config.performance` for Vue-specific performance markers in Chrome DevTools' performance timeline, see [official docs](https://vuejs.org/api/application.html#app-config-performance).
* [Vue DevTools Extension](https://vuejs.org/guide/scaling-up/tooling.html#browser-devtools)

The [official documentation](https://vuejs.org/guide/best-practices/performance.html#overview) provides more information about Vue's performance.
