The regular, synchronous way of loading components is:

```js
import MyComponent from './MyComponent.vue';
```

In large applications, it makes sense to split the code into smaller chunks and only load it from the server when it's needed.

Vue 3 therefore provides the `defineAsyncComponent`function:

```js
import { defineAsyncComponent } from 'vue';

const AsyncComp = defineAsyncComponent(() => {
  return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    // ...load component from server
    resolve(/* loaded component */);
  });
});
```

Now we can to use `AsyncComp` like a normal component in Vue.

[Here are the docs for Async Components in Vue 3.](https://v3.vuejs.org/guide/migration/async-components.html#async-components)

The syntax for Vue 2 is not that different:
```js
const AsyncComponent = () =>
import('./components/LazyLoadingFTW.vue');
```
