import TipCard from '../../../components/TipCard';

export const badCode = `<!-- In a template -->
<span>{{
  fullName.split(' ').map((word) => {
    return word[0].toUpperCase() + word.slice(1)
  }).join(' ')
}}</span>`.trim();

export const goodCode = `<!-- In a template -->
<span>{{ normalizedFullName }}</span>`.trim();

Your Vue component templates should only include simple expressions as they make your template more declarative.

If you have more complex expressions in your Vue.js component templates you should refactor them into computed properties or methods. This allows us to reuse the code.

<TipCard highlight="bad" language="js">
  {badCode}
</TipCard>

<br />

<TipCard highlight="good" language="js">
  {goodCode}
</TipCard>

<br />

We have moved the complex expression to a computed property:

```vue
<script setup>
const props = defineProps({ fullName: String });

const normalizedFullName = computed(() =>
  props.fullName
    .split(' ')
    .map((word) => word[0].toUpperCase() + word.slice(1))
    .join(' ')
);
</script>
```
