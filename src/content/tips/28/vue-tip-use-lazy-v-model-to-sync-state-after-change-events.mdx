By default, `v-model` syncs with the state of the Vue instance on every input event. The `.lazy` modifier changes the `v-model` to only sync after change events.

This modifier reduces the number of times our `v-model` is trying to sync with our Vue instance, which can increase the performance of your Vue application.

Let's take a look at a simple example:

```vue
<template>
  // highlight-next-line
  <input v-model.lazy="message"/>
</template>

<script setup>
import { watch, ref } from 'vue'

const message = ref('');

const saveMessage = () => {
  // do anything with the message
}

watch(message, (newMessage) => {
  saveMessage(newMessage) // only called on change events
})
</script>
```
