If you are using the new `<script setup>` syntax, you may run into a case where you need some Options API functionality.
In this case, it's possible to add an additional `<script>` block to your component. Vue will mix the two
together for you, so the Composition API code and Options API code can remain separate.

You may need a regular `<script>` block in these cases:

- Use the Options API to declare options that cannot be expressed in `<script setup>`, for example, `inheritAttrs` or custom options enabled via plugins.
- Run side effects or create objects that should only execute once because `setup()` is run for every component.
- Declare named exports which allow exporting multiple things from one file.

```vue
<script>
// Normal <script> using Options API, executed in module scope (only once)
runSideEffectOnce()

// Here you can declare additional options
export default {
  name: 'MyComponent',
  inheritAttrs: false,
  customOptions: {}
}
</script>

<script setup>
// Composition API: executed in setup() scope (for each instance)
import { ref } from 'vue';
console.log('Setting up new component instance');
const count = ref(0);
</script>
```

This feature is [officially supported and documented](https://vuejs.org/api/sfc-script-setup.html?ck_subscriber_id=1460864714#usage-alongside-normal-script).
