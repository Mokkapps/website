The double mustaches `{{ text }}` interprets the data as plain text, not HTML:

```vue
<p>Using text interpolation: {{ rawHtml }}</p>
```

In order to output real HTML, you will need to use the `v-html` directive:

```vue
<p>Using v-html directive: <span v-html="rawHtml"></span></p>
```

The contents of the `span` will be interpreted as plain HTML and all data bindings are ignored.

We cannot use `v-html` to compose template partials, because Vue is not a string-based templating engine.
Instead, components are preferred as the fundamental unit for UI reuse and composition.

[[warning]]
| Dynamically rendering arbitrary HTML on your website can be very dangerous because it can easily lead to XSS vulnerabilities. Only use `v-html` on trusted content and never on user-provided content.
