In some cases, we have to deal with third-party Vue components where we cannot put a ref on inner HTML elements to access them in our Vue code.

In these cases we can access [$el](https://vuejs.org/api/component-instance.html#el) on a [template ref](https://vuejs.org/guide/essentials/template-refs.html#template-refs=) on the third-party component:

```vue
<template>
  <ThirdPartyComponent ref="comp"/>
</template>

<script setup lang="ts">
  const compRef: Ref<typeof ThirdPartyComponent | null> = ref(null);
  const input: HTMLInputElement | null = compRef.value?.$el.querySelector('input');
</script>
```

[[info]]
| In general and for consistency, you should use [template refs](https://vuejs.org/guide/essentials/template-refs.html#template-refs=) for direct access to elements instead of relying on `$el`.
