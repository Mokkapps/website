The [watch hook](https://v3.vuejs.org/guide/composition-api-introduction.html#reacting-to-changes-with-watch) provides an option that its callback
function is called immediately:

```vue
<template>
  <input v-model="counter">
</template>

<script setup>
import { ref, watch } from "vue";

const counter = ref(0);

watch(
  counter,
  (newValue, oldValue) => {
    console.log("The new counter value is: " + counter.value);
  },
  // highlight-next-line
  { immediate: true }
);
</script>
```

This code will generate the output `New counter value is: 0` after the setup method is executed initially. It will also
create a log message for all subsequent counter value changes.
