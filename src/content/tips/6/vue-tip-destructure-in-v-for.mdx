I'm a big fan of [ES6 destructuring](https://hacks.mozilla.org/2015/05/es6-in-depth-destructuring/) and recently discovered that you can use it in `v-for`.

First, let's take a look at a `v-for` without using ES6 destructuring:

```html
<div v-for="article in articles" :key="article.id">
  <h2>{{ article.title }}</h2>
</div>
```

`articles` is a list of `article` JavaScript objects and has the type `Article[]`:

```ts
interface Article {
  title: string;
  id: string;
}
```

We can use ES6 destructuring which results in a cleaner template code:

```html
<div v-for="{id, title} in articles" :key="id">
  <h2>{{ title }}</h2>
</div>
```
