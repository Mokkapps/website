When using client-side routing using [Vue Router](https://router.vuejs.org/) we may want to scroll to top when navigating to a new route or preserve the scrolling position of history entries.

Vue Router allows us to completely customize the scroll behavior on route navigation.

[[warning]]
| This feature only works if the browser supports `history.pushState`.

When creating the router instance, we can provide the `scrollBehavior` function:

```js
const router = new VueRouter({
  routes: [...],
  scrollBehavior (to, from, savedPosition) {
    return { x: 0, y: 0 }
  }
})
```

The following code scrolls to the top of the page for all route navigations:

```js
scrollBehavior (to, from, savedPosition) {
  return { x: 0, y: 0 }
}
```

To achieve a native-like behavior when navigating with back/forward buttons we can return `savedPosition`:

```js
scrollBehavior (to, from, savedPosition) {
  if (savedPosition) {
    return savedPosition
  } else {
    return { x: 0, y: 0 }
  }
}
```
