Since [Vue 3](https://v3.vuejs.org/) it is possible to use reactive values in the `<style>`:

```vue
<template>
  <span class="label">Hello World!</span>
</template>

<script>
export default {
  props: {
    color: {
      type: String,
      default: 'blue',
    },
  }
};
</script>

<style>
  .label {
    color: v-bind(color);
  }
</style>
```

In this example we bind the `color` property of our Vue component to the CSS color property of our label.

Internally, Vue uses CSS variables that are scoped to each component.

More info can be found in the [official documentation](https://v3.vuejs.org/api/sfc-style.html?ck_subscriber_id=1460864714#state-driven-dynamic-css).
