The [v-once directive](https://v3.vuejs.org/api/directives.html#v-once) is a Vue.js directive that is used to avoid unwanted re-renders of an element.

It optimizes the update performance as it renders the element and component only once.

Vue will treat the element/component and all its children as static content on any subsequent re-render.

```vue
<p v-once>This text will never change: {{ message }}</p>
```

If we put the `v-once` directive on an element with children, these would also be treated as static content:

```vue
<section v-once>
  <h1>My Headline</h1>
  <p>{{ message }}</p>
</section>
```

| Since [3.2](https://v3.vuejs.org/api/directives.html#v-memo), you can also memoize part of the template with invalidation conditions using `v-memo`.
