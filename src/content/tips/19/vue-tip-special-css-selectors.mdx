## Deep Selectors

The `:deep()` CSS pseudo-class can be used if you want styles to apply to some "deeply" nested child components:

```vue
<style scoped>
  .a :deep(.b) {
  /* ... */
}
</style>
```

Vue will compile this code into:

```css
.a[data-v-f3f3eg9] .b {
/* ... */
}
```

[[info]]
| DOM content created with v-html is not affected by scoped styles, but you can still style them using deep selectors.

## Slotted Selectors

By default, scoped styles do not affect contents rendered by `<slot/>` but we can use the `:slotted` pseudo-selector to apply styles to slot content:

```vue
<style scoped>
:slotted(div) {
  color: red;
}
</style>
```

## Global Selectors

The `:global` pseudo-class can be used to globally apply a rule, even within the `<style scoped>` block:

```vue
<style scoped>
:global(.red) {
  color: red;
}
</style>
```

To be more specific, I recommend adding a second `<style>` block if you need to apply multiple global styles:

```vue
<style scoped>
:global(.red) {
  color: red;
}
</style>

<style>
  body {
  margin: 0;
  padding: 0;
}
</style>
```
